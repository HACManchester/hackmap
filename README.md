## Synopsis
Visual representation of people's hacking interests in a fantasy map.
A fantasy island with different regions (electronics, clothing, metalwork, woodwork...), places (soldering, arduino, sewing, knitting, lathe) and pins (representing peoples' interests).

Pins can be 
* Green : Interested, speak to me about it!
* Orange : I'd like to know and learn about it
* Red : ....? 

## Architecture
TBC. Presumably a file of interests that can be updated, a map, a database to store peoples interests.

## Steps
* Create tree of interests
* settle on a nice mapping technology 
* choose db technology
* mash the data into the map
* allow users to pin their interests

## Future
* Whitelabeled so other spaces can clone project
* user profiles
* ???
